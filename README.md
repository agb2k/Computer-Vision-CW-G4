- Open source implementation of SIFT: PythonSIFT (Go through README to figure out usage)
- Pretrained model for sample seed detector has been removed as it's too large for GitHub
- Use "Dataset" folder as dataset for project
- The "DatasetTest" folder was created for the transfer learning experiments
